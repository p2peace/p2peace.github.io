          <h2>The problem</h2>
          <h3>Physical security sucks whether you're rich or
          poor</h3>
          <ul>
            <!--
            <li>ABBREVIATE THIS: The rich live in a condo [or a
            similar allegedely-protected space]. A "security"
            company installs cameras and alarm systems all over the
            place (a huge intel/paedo source, mind you) and are
            physically protected by an armed guard at thr lobby,
            This can deter common criminal (heads up: "uncommon"
            ones are not affected: <a href=
            "https://archive.is/i6HcP#selection-357.0-365.44">https://archive.is/i6HcP#selection-357.0-365.44</a>
            ], but fails miserably once so-called social order
            collapses [e.g. a civil war]: the guard at the gate is
            either from the losing side (i.e. dead, or hiding in
            the mountains) or worse [i.e. looting the premises].
            </li>
            <li>ABBREVIATE: The poor get the short end of the stick
            (unless they win a civil war :p). They're either
            "protected" by the police (serving the rich) or [if
            social order allows it] a gang [at least they're also
            protected from tax collectors]. If they try to organize
            in order to defend themselves, they're either a gang
            (threatened by both the state and rivaling gangs) or
            worse: someone declares them a "terrorist group" and
            then even the Magna Carta stops protecting them.</li>
            -->
            <li>The rich are [pretty nuch] protected until things go south
            <li>The poor can't even afford <em>that</em>
          </ul>
        <p>TL;DR - in order to be safe, you should be a violent
        motherfokker (which is dangerous to your mental
        health).</p>

        <h2>The need</h2>
        <ul>
          <!--
          <li>ABBREVIATE: Everyone well-versed in 70s Kung Fu
          movies knows that when a village is being harassed by
          bandits. the last thing you want to do is appeal to the
          emperor. What you get is soldiers looting and raping you
          instead of bandits (who are at least a bit afraid of the
          law.</li>
          <li>The proper solution according to that narrative is
          for the peasants to practice Kung Fu. Since people are
          lazy, bandits should cause a "critical mass" of
          discomfort in order to be arsed to train.</li>
          <li>Despite the shortcomings of this method, it is more
          profound (as long as we're talking about proper Kung Fu
          training (and not arm-the-poor schemes like the "Free"
          Syrian Army or even sicker experiments like Somalia). If
          you "learn to figh like any good boy should" [ <a href=
          "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xvRdcwyvH0&amp;t=46">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xvRdcwyvH0&amp;t=46</a>
          (fuck German copyright mafia. Listen to the original if
          you live in the free world)], your goal is to avoid
          conflict. No "smart weapon" can teach you that (lazy
          peasants).
          </li>
          -->
          <li>You can only trust protection from someone who has an incentive (friends, family, "co-victims").
          <li>This should be simple and fun. Training has hidden costs (e.g. mental).
          <li><strong>Most alarms are false</strong> response shouldn't be stressful for you and others (<em>"You no spook civillians, scheisskopf"</em>).
          <li><em>Some</em> false alarm are tests (e.g. fake "Jehova witness" scouting before attack). Respond fast, document everything, but stay cool about it.
          <li>Prefer non-violent actors (old ladies are the best).
